For this  reason , vaccinatio n is considered one of the greatest \\npublic health achievements of the 20 th century [1]. The history of public  concerns about and  questioning of \\nvaccines , however,  is as old as vaccines themselves. As the widespread use of vaccines has grown, so have \\nanxiet ies about vaccine safety and their regulation  [2]. Modern day communication capacities have provided \\nmany new platforms for speeding up the spread of these anxieties. Current ly, most countries in Europe and many \\nglobally,  are dealing with pockets of people  who are reluctant or refuse recommended vaccination (s), or who \\nchose to delay some vaccines. This phenomenon is defined as vaccine hesitancy (to be further described below).  \\nThis catalogue developed by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Va ccine Confidence Project is \\npart of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control’s activities aimed to provide tools and \\ninformation resources to support EU/EEA countries in addressing the challenging issue of vaccine hesitancy. The \\nproject was d eveloped in the context of ECDC’s support to EU/EEA Member States in prevention and control of \\nvaccine\\xadpreventable diseases, including effective communication to promote immunisation.  \\nVaccine hesitancy is defined as  \\n‘a behaviour, influenced by a number of  factors including issues of confidence (level of trust in vaccine \\nor provider), complacency (do not perceive a need for a vaccine, do not value the vaccine), and \\nconvenience (access). Vaccine -hesitant individuals are a heterogeneous group that are indecis ive in \\nvarying degrees about specific vaccines or vaccination in general. Vaccine -hesitant individuals may \\naccept all vaccines but remain concerned about vaccines, some may refuse or delay some vaccines, but \\naccept others, and some individuals may refuse a ll vaccines ’ [3].  \\nDue to the diversity of  situations in which vaccine hesitancy can arise , interventions have to be contact specific \\n(depending on the public involved) and problem specific (depending on the type of concern).   \\nThis catalogue  provides examp les of practices that can serve as  a bank of ideas for other countries. It takes in to \\nconsideration the importan ce of identifying  the underlying issues that generat e vaccine hesitancy in order to \\nappropriately  address them. Hence, the catalogue is divided into two parts: first, interventions to diagnose the \\nhesitancy (metric tools and assessment instruments) ; and secondly, interventions to address the issue once \\ndefined (what to do at the individual and community level to tackle the problem).    \\nThe current project will further complement the work done by ECDC in the area of supporting countries when \\naddressing  vaccine  hesitan cy to effective ly promote vaccination uptake , by providing supplementary data and \\npractical resources that countries can use and adapt according to their national and local approaches and needs .  \\nAim \\nThe aim of this catalogue it to provide a practical tool for public health organisations and immunisation \\nstakeholders in the EU/EEA to address the challenging problem of vaccine hesitancy. T he catalogue offers a \\ncollection of interventions developed in EU/EEA countries as well as in other regions to measure and address \\nvaccine hesitancy, and showcases examples of practices that can be adapted according to national and local \\nneeds and strategi es.  \\nMethods  \\nThe interventions included in this catalogue were identified through four different routes:  \\n\\uf0b7 review of ECDC’s technical reports on understanding vaccine hesitancy  [4, 5] \\n\\uf0b7 review of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization report on strategies to \\naddress vaccine hesitancy  [6, 7] \\n\\uf0b7 web search and review of the lit erature on strategies to address vaccine hesitancy published since the \\ncompletion of the above two reviews  \\n\\uf0b7 consultations with relevant experts . \\nCatalogue of interventions addressing vaccine hesitancy  TECHNICAL REPORT  \\n2 1.

Practical tips and lessons learnt  \\n4.1 Diagnostic tools  \\nIn recent years, different types of tools have been developed to measure, assess or monitor vaccine hesitancy. \\nSome of these aim to measure hesitancy at an individual level, identifying hesitan t parents or adults and detecting \\ntheir concerns and worries about vaccination. Interventions that have been evaluated showed that such tools are \\neffective to measure vaccine hesitancy and that they can also be useful predictors of vaccine uptake or serve as \\ncomparative tools to assess hesitancy in different populations of the world. Other tools are used to measure \\nvaccine hesitancy at a country level, by gathering information from national immunisation programme managers. \\nThese tools have not been evaluate d yet but have been implemented successfully in various countries. Finally, a \\ntool was also developed to monitor vaccine hesitancy through mass and social media and was found to be effective \\nin identifying concerns and sentiments about vaccination online.  \\nMeasurement and/or monitoring of concerns about vaccination is an important first step of any intervention aiming \\nto address vaccine hesitancy. All countries should have a system in place to regularly listen to concerns and worries \\nthe population might ha ve about vaccines. The tools described in this catalogue have been implemented in \\ndifferent countries and can be used and adapted to different contexts, vaccines or populations. They can serve as a \\nbasis for either reactive or proactive interventions aimin g to reduce vaccine hesitancy.  \\n4.2 Individual -level interventions focusing on parents  \\nTable 2 .

However in the current context, we deﬁne vaccine\\nhesitancy as the behaviours, beliefs about vaccine safety and efﬁ-\\ncacy, attitudes about mandates, and trust towards vaccines. Recent\\nwork recognizes vaccine hesitancy as stemming from people’s\\nexperiences with illness, biomedical institutions and interventions\\nand injustice, and their relationship with government and the sci-\\nentiﬁc community [4,8 40] . In the era of vaccine hesitancy and pan-\\ndemic threats, there is an acute need to develop an approach to\\nreduce and address apprehension towards vaccinations [25].\\nHealthcare providers (HCPs) not only have the unique oppor-\\ntunity to address and educate patients about vaccinations in\\ntheir respective roles, they are often seen by the public as the\\nmost trusted source of information regarding vaccination\\n[52,62] . Their recommendations continue to hold a signiﬁcant\\npositive inﬂuence in the vaccination decision-making process\\n[63 79 89] and the relationship is the cornerstone of vaccine con-\\nﬁdence [26]. HCPs cited their attitudes towards vaccination,\\nknowledge of vaccinations and preparedness with adequate\\ntraining as enabling factors to engage in difﬁcult conversations,\\nespecially with those who demonstrate reluctance or hesitancy\\ntowards vaccination [66].\\nRecent systematic reviews have explored the aspects of HCP\\nattitudes and knowledge [48,49] but we did not identify any\\nreviews that summarized available literature on interventions\\naddressing preparedness in HCPs speciﬁcally. Only one scoping\\nreview by Karras et al. [44]examined the availability of dialogue-\\nbased resources to support HCP, which provided some limited\\ninsight on the topic. In a comprehensive systematic review, Dube\\net al. [26] found that most interventions focused on information\\nsharing and education about vaccination to both HCP and patients\\nalike. Furthermore, one study demonstrated that vaccination-\\nrelated curriculum content across medicine, nursing and pharmacy\\ntraining was highly variable, with a median of 12–23 h, where only\\n21 % of participants felt they received adequate vaccination teach-\\ning during training [67]. Content is often focused on vaccination\\nprinciples [67]and HCP trainees have consistently identiﬁed a\\ngap in teaching of communication strategies and practical skills\\n[75 42] .\\nEnabling HCPs to effectively engage in vaccine discussions\\ntherefore must involve providing training in practical skills and\\ncommunication strategies to enhance provider preparedness, in\\naddition to provision of knowledge and encouraging the accep-\\ntance of vaccinations. The discussion of vaccines is a complex\\ninteraction requiring verbal and nonverbal communication skills,\\nactive listening, recognizing and addressing denialism and\\nengaging in a longitudinal process [24 64 90] . In addition, the\\noverall social-emotional competence of the provider [88], emo-\\ntion regulation after difﬁcult conversations, and self-debrieﬁng\\ntechniques [33,78] have been described as a tenet of effective\\npersuasion.\\nA recent global survey demonstrates differences in attitudes\\nand acceptance of vaccines by geography and associated contexts\\nincluding age and sex distribution, income, education and trust\\nin government [46]. Vaccine communication strategies need to\\ntake into account local contexts to increase efﬁcacy. Our pragmatic\\napproach, focused on the North American context, recognizes this\\ncultural context of vaccine hesitancy as we aim to identify, explore,\\nand map the literature on existing vaccine hesitancy educational\\ntools for healthcare providers who provide vaccine counseling to\\npatients. In our scoping review, we conducted a grey literature\\nreview of North American interventions. We expanded our scope\\nof primary literature to the global context, without geographic lim-\\nitation. While these interventions may be less applicable to the\\nlocal context, the rigor of the review process may provide valuableinsights that can be extrapolated with respect to methodology and\\nevaluation. The results of this scoping review will identify the gaps\\nin literature and inform the development of a multidisciplinary\\neducational program for healthcare provider trainees to prepare\\nthem for their future roles in vaccine advocacy, promotion and\\ndelivery.\\n2.

Individuals  reg-\\nularly take medicines and  other  treatments  when  they  fall  ill\\n(sometimes with  non-negligible  side  effects),  but  they  do  so  for\\na purpose, to  prevent,  control,  or  alleviate  symptoms  from  a  con-\\ndition  that  they  know  they  have.

Vaccine  hesitancy  in  the  European  Union\\nRates  of  vaccine  hesitancy  vary  internationally.  In  2015  Larson\\net  al.  reviewed  data  on  vaccine  conﬁdence  and  hesitancy  from  sur-\\nveys  in  67  countries,  including  65,819  individuals  in  total  [10].

Figs.  1  and  2  show\\nthe proportion  of  respondents  who  disagree  with  the  following\\nstatements:  “Vaccines  are  important  for  children  to  have”;  “Overall\\nI  think  vaccines  are  safe”.  The  category  “disagree”  combines  those\\nwho  “tend  to  disagree”  and  “strongly  disagree”.\\nFig.  1  shows  that,  in  15  of  the  20  countries,  less  than  10%  of\\nrespondents  disagreed  with  the  statement  that  vaccines  are  impor-\\nFig. 1.

In  10  countries  it  is  between\\n10%  and  20%,  while  it  is  over  20%  in  4  countries.  Thus,  although  at\\nleast  85%  of  respondents  in  each  country  think  that  vaccines  are\\nimportant,  vaccine  safety  remains  a  signiﬁcant  concern,  affecting\\nas  many  as  40%  of  respondents  in  France.  Given  that  herd  immunity\\ntypically  requires  coverage  rates  in  excess  of  95%,  these  ﬁgures  give\\ncause  for  concern.\\nA  report  by  Larson  et  al.  provides  more  up-to-date  data  on\\nchanges  of  conﬁdence  in  vaccines  over  time  (between  2015  and\\n2018)  [11].  Patterns  vary  markedly  among  countries.  For  example,\\nconﬁdence  increased  in  all  domains  in  Greece,  Italy,  Slovenia  and\\nthe UK,  but  decreased  in  all  domains  in  Poland.  Conﬁdence  in  vac-\\ncine  safety  also  increased  in  Demark,  France,  Netherlands,  Spain\\nand  Romania,  but  decreased  in  Sweden,  Finland,  Germany  and  the\\nCzech  Republic.  Older  (55+)  and  better  educated  citizens  are  more\\nlikely  to  hold  a  positive  view  of  vaccination  than  those  who  are\\nyounger  and  less  educated.\\nA  recent  Eurobarometer  report  is  based  on  ﬁeldwork  under-\\ntaken  in  March  2019  [12].  Many  of  the  questions  differ  from  those\\nin the  earlier  surveys,  precluding  precise  comparisons  but  offering\\nadditional  insights.  As  Fig.  3  shows,  while  overall  vaccines  are  seen\\nas  effective,  over  1  person  in  5  does  not  agree  in  several  member\\nstates  that  they  are  effective.\\n3.

Structure of the catalogue and standardised description \\nof interventions  \\nExtensive research on vaccine hesitancy has shown that the first step in responding to vaccine hesitancy should \\nconsist of identifying determinants of vaccine hesitancy  and concerns raised by hesitant populations. Therefore, \\nthe first section of the catalogue lists relevant interventions that focus on developing tools to measure the scope \\nand scale of vaccine hesitancy in various populations. These diagnostic tools can t hen be used by public health \\nprofessionals to inform the development of targeted interventions to address vaccine hesitancy.  \\nThe second section of the catalogue focuses on interventions designed to  address or respond to vaccine \\nhesitancy. It is subdivided  into three categories: individual -level interventions focusing on parents ; individual -level \\ninterventions focusing on improving healthcare workers’ confidence and communication skills to respond to \\nhesitant patients ; and interventions focusing on respondi ng to hesitancy at a community level.   \\nEach intervention included in the catalogue  addressing vaccine hesitancy is described in a standardised way:  \\n\\uf0b7 aim \\n\\uf0b7 determinants of hesitancy targeted ( safety issues, trust, religious and philosophical views, misinformat ion, \\nmandates, perceived benefits, and general vaccine hesitancy ).  \\n\\uf0b7 country of intervention  \\n\\uf0b7 setting  \\n\\uf0b7 target population  \\n\\uf0b7 organisation/individuals administering the intervention  \\n\\uf0b7 particular vaccine(s) of focus  \\n\\uf0b7 type of intervention ( dialogue -based, incentive -based, reminder -recall based, diagnostic tool, advocacy \\ncampaign ) \\n\\uf0b7 funding  \\n\\uf0b7 main components of the intervention  \\n\\uf0b7 evaluation  \\n\\uf0b7 links to relevant publications or resources  \\nThe different determinants of hesitancy were chosen to reflect the most important drivers of  vaccine hesitancy \\npresent in Europe (identified in ECDC’s technical report on understanding vaccine hesitancy  [5]) and were based \\non the SAGE determinants of vaccine hesitancy. The types of intervention were also informed by the SAGE \\ncategories of interve ntions addressing vaccine hesitancy.   \\nFinally, a summary of practical tips and lessons learnt is provided  at the end of the catalogue in order to support \\ncountries with the adaptation of interventions, making them context specific and culturally appropriat e.  \\n  \\nCatalogue of interventions addressing vaccine hesitancy  TECHNICAL REPORT  \\n4 1.

We included 39 quantitative and qualitative studies conducted in \\nWestern countries, published since 2015, that assessed VH among HCPs in general, for several vaccines. \\nStudies were reviewed using the WHO 3Cs model – (lack of) confidence, complacency, and (lack of) \\nconvenience.\\nExpert opinion: Despite the lack of validated tools and substantial heterogeneity in the methods used \\nto measure VH among HCPs, this review confirms its presence in this population, at frequencies that \\nvary by country, profession type, setting, and level of medical education. Lack of knowledge and \\nmistrust in health authorities/pharmaceutical industry/experts were among its principal drivers. \\nImproving the content about vaccination in HCPs’ training programs, facilitating access to reliable \\ninformation for use during consultations, and developing and validating instruments to measure HCPs’ \\nVH and its determinants are key to addressing VH among HCPs.ARTICLE HISTORY\\nReceived 6 January 2022  \\nAccepted 17 March 2022  \\nKEYWORDS\\nComplacency; convenience; \\nhealth-care providers; \\nreview; self-vaccination; \\nvaccine confidence; vaccine \\nhesitancy; vaccine \\nrecommendations\\n1.Introduction\\nAlthough the scientific and medical consensus on vaccina -\\ntion’s benefits is clear and unambiguous, skepticism about \\nvaccination continues to grow in the general population \\n[1,2], including for the new COVID-19 vaccines [3,4]. Vaccine \\nhesitancy (VH, i.e. ‘[m]otivational state of being conflicted \\nabout, or opposed to, getting vaccinated; including intentions \\nand willingness’ [5]) poses a threat to the success of vaccina -\\ntion, as vaccination efficacy relies on high uptake, especially \\nduring the current COVID-19 pandemic [6,7]. In 2019, the \\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) identified VH as one of the \\n10 most important issues in global health [1].\\nA better understanding of the dynamics and underlying issues \\nof VH and vaccine refusal is critical to address public health con-\\ncerns about vaccination. Vaccination decisions are complex, multi -\\ndimensional, and can be vaccine-specific [8,9]. Vaccine-hesitant \\nindividuals constitute the ‘middle ground’ of the spectrum \\nbetween those who are strongly supportive and those stridently \\nopposed; gains in improving vaccination acceptance and uptake \\ncould be the most immediate and productive in this group.The interaction between patients and health-care provi -\\nders (HCPs) is the keystone enabling confidence in vaccina -\\ntion and successful reduction of VH [10,11]. Studies in high-, \\nmiddle-, and limited-resource settings have consistently \\nshown that most parents look to their child’s HCP for infor -\\nmation and advice on vaccine-preventable diseases, vac-\\ncines, and the recommended schedule [12,13]. Patients \\nhave a high level of trust in their providers, whether doctors \\nor nurses [14]. When HCPs communicate effectively with \\ntheir patients about vaccine benefits and risks, the value \\nof and need for vaccinations, and vaccine safety, patients \\nare more confident in their decisions. To do this well, how -\\never, HCPs must themselves be confident about the safety, \\neffectiveness, and importance of vaccination. Previous stu-\\ndies have indicated that a significant proportion of HCPs, \\nincluding those who administer vaccines, are vaccine-'),\n",

Different manual browser searches and their limitations mentioned by the studies using the tool  \\nSocial media tool  Limitations  \\nYouTube search browser \\n[32,93 -103] • Despite the use of a variety of search terms being seen as a strength of the study, only \\nthe top 50 hits according to relevance were chosen to be analysed (this is in the context \\nof the three million videos posted on the topic of vaccines currently on YouTube at the \\ntime of the project) [96] \\nFacebook search tool \\n[45,104,105,108,109,112,113]  • Due to the time intensity that assessing each Facebook site required, it was impractical \\nto analyse each site in detail. Another limitation mentioned was that the focus of the \\nassessment was on the most recent posts. The nature of posts on Facebook sites may \\nchange as new information regarding vaccines reaches the general public, such as \\nduring flu season or when school starts, and parents must turn in their child’s vaccination records. During the short time for the data collection, there was no major \\nnews related to vaccines that had recently been reaching the general public. Finally, the \\nauthors did not gather data regarding individual users and cannot determine whe ther \\nactivity on the site centred on several engaged users or was spread among site membership [104]  \\n• A small limitation to using a Hypertext PreProcessor (PHP) script supplied by Facebook \\nas an add -on to the basic Facebook search tool as the script served to only collect each \\npost’s first 25 comments - this me ant that not all comments for every post were \\nanalysed. However, it was not considered a strong limitation since each post or \\ncomment was analysed as an individual unit. From the sampling frame, a sample of \\n2 289 items were randomly selected using a ‘rando mise numbers’ command. This was \\nconsidered a representative sample of the initial sampling frame. This study was made \\nbefore the data protection ethics and protocols linked to the 2018 General Data \\nProtection Regulation (GDPR) rules came into place [135] , although all the data were \\nanonymised and available for scientific use, the authors acknowledged that this methodology may give ris e to ethical concerns, given that identifiable comments made \\nby people on public Facebook pages are scrutinised. Nevertheless, at the time of the study (2016), according to the Codes of Ethics and Conduct of Internet Research [136] , \\nif an observation of public behaviour takes place in public fora where subjects would \\nexpect to be observed by strangers (such as a n open Facebook discussion), explicit \\nindividual consent is not required. If this search was made today, however, the analysis \\nof potential identifiable user posts on Facebook would be limited [109] . \\n• Luisi (2018) [45], found that the Facebook search feature does not al low users to \\norganise results by date or engagement (e.g. likes/comments). This limits flexibility in \\ndata collection. Technology also limited the ability to archive Facebook posts. When \\nloading the search results, one would have to scroll down to make the  area printable. \\nScrolling down too far would cause internet browsers to crash. Moreover , this study only \\ncollected public Facebook content in an effort to only analyse content that would be \\navailable to any Facebook user, because access to private social media feeds is not \\npossible without specific participant consent.'),\n",

Two are research specialists, assisting with literature reviews, manuscript writing, and implementing interventions; one is a statistician, who conducts data analysis; one is a graphic designer; and one is a director with a PhD in behavioral sciences, who oversees the unit’s scientific and strategic work. All except for the statistician, who was recruited through a uni-versity partnership, were assigned to the unit from the MoH. Most staff members had formal education in public health or medicine; to build their behavioral science capacity, the government supported capacity-building exercises with other organizations. \\n \\nProcess  The team takes proactive and reactive approaches to conducting be-havioral projects at the MoH. Its proactive approach involves noticing challenges at the MoH level and speaking with stakeholders to de-termine whether these challenges warrant a larger project. The re-active approach involves receiving requests from MoH departments about services that could use improvements, such as low uptake of the flu vaccine. Once the team has decided on a project, it follows the IDEA framework, which the unit developed as a guide for designing and implementing behavioral interventions. The team also published a first-of-its-kind behavioral health toolkit to guide practitioners in \\ndiagnosing, developing, and implementing behavioral interventions in public health.\\n—83—\\n BACK  \\n TO INDEX\\nBEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AROUNDTHE WORLD VOLUME III  Select projects  •  Using precommitment to increase virtual medical appointment \\nattendance. Missed health appointments are disruptive and costly \\nto the health-care system. A prior qualitative study revealed that patients often failed to show up because they did not know their appointment would be virtual. To increase medical appointment at-tendance, the Health Nudge Team implemented a printed consent form that patients were required to sign after an in-person appoint-ment asking them to check off that they realized that their next appointment would be virtual. This behaviorally informed commit-ment device led to an 18% increase in appointment attendance. \\n• Increasing COVID-19 vaccine appointment bookings using social norms messaging. To encourage COVID-19 vaccine uptake, the unit conducted a multi-arm RCT examining which message frames would increase vaccine appointment bookings. They tested commit-ment framing, loss aversion framing, salience framing, social norms framing, and ego framing. All except commitment framing resulted in significantly more booked appointments than the control. Social norms framing had the highest rate of booked appointments (21%), followed by ego framing (19%) and salience framing (19%) (Alhajji, Alzeer, and Alshehri 2022).\\n• Understanding knowledge about and attitudes toward organ dona-tion to design interventions. Organ availability is inadequate in Saudi \\nArabia. To better understand why some citizens sign up for organ donation and others do not, the Health Nudge Team administered a questionnaire to assess people’s knowledge about and attitudes toward organ donation. They discovered that people are knowledge-able about organ donation but that religious beliefs, cultural justifica-tions, and negative attitudes stop them from registering. This finding led the team to advise policymakers to focus on initiatives that shift  the public mindset and create a new social norm rather than simply providing facts and information.\\n \\nFuture of behavioral science  The unit is viewed as a key strategic enabler for public health. The team aims to build a core national behavioral science function that supports end-to-end delivery of campaigns for public health programs, working closely with implementing entities and the Ministry of Media. The unit sees an opportunity for the public health agenda to use technology in a cutting-edge way to provide world-class digital, personalized behav-ioral programs.\\n—84—\\n BACK  \\n TO INDEX\\nBEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AROUNDTHE WORLD VOLUME III  Special Thanks:\\nDr. Mohammed Alhajji\\nBehavioural Insights and Nudge Unit\\n BACK  \\n TO INDEX\\nBEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AROUNDTHE WORLD VOLUME III SINGAPORECOUNTRY PROFILES Background and Overview  86\\nNational Government Behavioral Insights Unit 87\\n—86—\\n BACK  \\n TO INDEX\\nBEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AROUNDTHE WORLD VOLUME III Background and \\nOverview\\nThe Ministry of Health have been leveraging BI as a tool for policy \\nand programme implementation since 2018.\\nThe Ministry works with BI experts to support MoH’s vision of cham-\\npioning a healthy nation where residents live well, long and with peace of mind.\\nPhoto Credit: Stijn Dijkstra\\n—87—\\n BACK  \\n TO INDEX'),\n",

The team then uses the Behaviour Change Wheel to match poten-tial interventions with the barriers identified. Finally, using self-report measures and administrative data, the team analyzes whether the im-plemented intervention changed behavior.\\n \\nSelect projects  In most cases, LabGob gets its work through proactive outreach from government institutions. It has implemented 33 innovative solutions; a selection of its health-related projects is overviewed below.\\n• Improving children’s mental health during isolation due to COV -\\nID-19. During the pandemic, more than 800,000 Chilean children \\nwere unable to go to school in person. In partnership with the Un-\\ndersecretary of Early Childhood Education, LabGob created a be-haviorally informed program to foster child development at home. The program encouraged parents to read stories to their children and physical play, which led to 32% and 8.5% improvements in mental health measures, respectively, according to an RCT (Labora-torio de Gobierno n.d.).\\n• Supporting women experiencing domestic violence. After domestic violence increased during COVID-19 lockdowns, LabGob worked with the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity and the Nation-al Service of Women and Gender Equity to create a WhatsApp channel where women who lived with their aggressor could pro-vide information and receive emotional support. Meta funded the channel’s development and three months of service support. This channel led to a 13% increase in reporting of domestic violence and has become a permanent service channel.\\n—135—\\n BACK  \\n TO INDEX\\nBEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AROUNDTHE WORLD VOLUME III • Encouraging uptake of e-prescriptions by physicians.

According to the United Nations, in 2018, \\nalmost 8 million people were living with HIV in South Africa. Teen-age schoolgirls are three times as likely to be HIV positive as boys their age, in part because of age-disparate sexual relationships with older men. To correct the misperception of girls in South Africa that older men are safer sexual partners, the unit launched an HIV risk game that provided young girls with information about HIV risk. The unit wanted to determine whether providing information about HIV risk in the form of a game would be more effective than traditional methods of information provision (e.g., awareness campaigns and bill-boards). The treatment group that played the HIV game was signifi-cantly more likely to identify correctly which of two hypothetical indi-viduals of different ages was more likely to have HIV, answering twice \\n—160—\\n BACK  \\n TO INDEX\\nBEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AROUNDTHE WORLD VOLUME III as many questions correctly as those in the control group, which was \\ngiven an essay on HIV to read.

In paragraph 33 of the Concluding observations, the Committee invites Lat via to \\nintensify its efforts to eradicate poverty, further referring to specific measures, including by \\nadopting a national plan on eradicating poverty, alleviating the impact of the Covid -19 \\npandemic, etc. In reply, Latvia underlines that its approach in eradicating poverty is \\nhorizontal, introducing targets, obligations and measures in sectoral documents so that the \\nexperts in the specific field, be it social integration, healthcare, education, or social insurance, \\netc., are guided by the necessity to red uce and eradicate poverty, and the applicable principles \\nand guidelines are established in the document that directly deals with their field.  \\n10. The National Sustainable Development Strategy until 2030 establishes that the \\npoverty risk index should be reduce d by 16% by 2030. The mid -term National Development \\nPlan for 2021 –2017 foresees several social inclusion targets in a wider context. The \\nGuidelines for Social protection and Labour Market for 2021 –2027 (‘Guidelines’) establish \\naims, indexes and measures to  increase income for the groups of society that have been at \\nrisk of poverty, providing the necessary social services, possibilities to enter into a safe \\nworking environment. The mid -term policy target  is to facilitate social inclusion, reduce \\nincome inequ alities, reduce poverty by providing stable and adequate material support to \\nattain economic independence. Aid is provided so that it is adequate and sustainable, but \\nwould not reduce motivation to enter labour market. According to the Guidelines  by 2027:  \\n• The newly -provided pensions will not be smaller than 40% of the average wage \\nsubject to social insurance contributions;  \\n• Financial aid by the State will reduce poverty risk by at least 20% overall, including \\nby at least 35% for pensioners; and by 20% for ch ildren;  \\n• The number of households with income below the level of needy households will be \\nreduced by 11%.  \\n11. Four action plans to reduce poverty have been adopted focusing on the needs of \\npersons with disabilities, equal opportunities between sexes in employme nt and employment \\nsafety, and the development of social services. The Plan on the improvement of the support \\nsystem for minimum income for 2022 –2024 (‘Plan’) aims to clarify and improve the \\nparameters for defining the minimum income level according to the economic development \\nof Latvia and their review. It foresees an annual review of the thresholds and methods for \\ndetermining the minimum income level, and an annual increase of the minimum level of \\nincome threshold (as from 2023). The Plan  establishes that State co -finances local \\ngovernments in providing basic social support benefits, guaranteed minimum income (‘GMI’) \\nbenefits, and housing benefits. These support measures are applicable to: recipients of the \\nGMI benefit, needy households, low -income househol ds, recipients of the State minimum \\npension and social security benefits. The new system for establishing the threshold of \\nminimum income will be based on a percentage of the medium minimum income, instead of \\nthe current system, which is based on numerical  approach, and will enter into force in July \\n2023.

According to the Implementing decisions of the European Commission,9 in 2013 –\\n2019, Latvia met its obligations and goals as set in the Decision no.406/2009/EC on the effort \\nof Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emi ssions to meet the Community’s \\ngreenhouse gas emission reduction commitments up to 2020. According to the GHG stock -\\ntaking of 2022, Latvia achieved its targets for 2020. It is estimated that Latvia will comply \\nwith its EU targets for 2013 –2030, which is a reduction of GHG emissions by 6% (compared \\nto 2005 levels). The 2021 estimate showed that with the measures already taken by Latvia, \\nthe level of GHG emissions will have been reduced by 7% (compared to 2005 levels), and \\nby 9% (compared 2005 levels) with ad ditional measures.10 Based on the Latvian \\n  \\n 2 https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu -action/eu -emissions -trading -system -eu-ets/auctioning_en .  \\n 3 https://likumi.lv/ta/id/330568  and https://ekii.lv/index.php?page=atbalsts -majsaimniecibam . \\n 4 https://likumi.lv/ta/id/328761  and https://ekii.lv/index.php?page=atbalsts -transportlidzekliem . \\n 5 https://m.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=279830 ;https://ekii.lv/index.php?mact=Konkurs,cntnt01,  \\nfe_konkurs_detail,0&cntnt01current_id=7&cntnt01returnid=25 . \\n 6 https://m.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=334008 ;https://ekii.lv/index.php?mact=Konkurs,cntn t01, \\nfe_konkurs_detail,0&cntnt01current_id=10&cntnt01returnid=25 . \\n 7 https://tapportals.mk.gov.lv/legal_acts/7987de45 -93fd-45e3 -ac4c-948251c622d9 .  \\n 8 https://likumi.lv/ta/id/338391 -klimata -un-energetikas -ministrijas -nolikums .  \\n 9 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013D0162&from=LV .  \\n 10 EU Commission, Country Factsheet: Latvia, available:  \\n  https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/default/files/strategies/progress/docs/lv_2020_factsheet_en.pdf . \\nE/C.12/LVA/FCO/2  \\n4 GE.23 -04982  Environment, Geology and Meteorology Centre’s report on 2022, Latvia will likely meet its'),\n",

On 5 March 2021, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \\n(‘Committee’) adopted Concluding Observations on the second periodic report of the \\nRepublic of Latvia (Latvia) on the implementation of the International Covenant on \\nEconomic, Social  and Cultural Rights (‘Concluding observations’) (E/C.12/LVA/CO/2). \\nThis document contains follow -up information in response to the Committee’s \\nrecommendations as requested in paragraph 53 of the Concluding observations, specifically \\nrecommendations nos.11  (climate), 33 (poverty) and 41 (healthcare response to the Covid -\\n19 pandemic).  \\n  Follow -up information relating to paragraph 11 of the concluding \\nobservations (E/C.12/ LVA/CO/2 ) \\n2. In recommendation no.11, the Committee recommended Latvia to “enhance its effor ts \\nto mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change on economic, social and cultural rights, \\nincluding by taking measures to achieve its nationally determined contribution under the \\nParis Agreement and for the implementation of its transition to a net zer o greenhouse gas \\nemissions economy by 2050. ” \\n3. As a member to the European Union, Latvia is bound by the nationally determined \\ncontributions (‘NDC’) of the EU under the Paris Agreement (‘PA’), and its legal framework, \\nincluding the European Climate Law estab lishing that by 2030 the EU greenhouse gas \\n(‘GHG’) emissions must be reduced by 55% (compared to 1990), and that by 2050 the EU \\nmust become climate -neutral. The EU reviews the compliance of the measures adopted by \\nLatvia with the EU law, and, by extension,  the PA. Although Latvia is not a party to Annex \\nII to the UNFCCC, Latvia has voluntarily contributed financially and expertise -wise to \\nassisting other States in achieving climate -neutrality: Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, \\nUzbekistan, and others.  \\n4. Latvia has adopted 5 policy documents and strategies: Latvia’s Climate Neutrality \\nStrategy for 2050; National Energy and Climate Plan until 20 30; Latvian National Plan for \\nAdaptation to Climate Change until 2030; National Development Plan 2021 –2027; \\nGuidel ines for Environmental Policies between 2021 and 2027 establishing Latvia’s \\nobligation to become climate -neutral by 2050 and setting out the directions, lines of action, \\nshort -term goals, monitoring systems, progress reports (from 2023 onwards), etc. for a ll \\nsectors to comply with this target1 Latvia has discussed these policy planning documents and \\nstrategies with the non -governmental sector, inviting them to submit comments, amendments, \\nand proposals.

This means that significant \\nnumbers of households incur catastrophic expenditure. \\nSubstantial improvement in accessibility to care will \\nremain difficult given the current level of resources in \\nthe Latvian health system. While some improvements \\nmay bring efficiency gains, most may require at least \\nsome upfront investment. To achieve health outcomes \\ncloser to EU averages, while making real inroads into \\nproblems of access and quality, dedicating a higher \\nshare of public budget to health will be needed.Latvia\\n0 100 200 300203Treatable \\nmortality93\\n332\\n161\\nLatvia EUPreventable \\nmortality\\nAge-standardised mortality rate per \\n100 0000 population, 2016\\nState of Health in the EU: Companion Report 2019                 71Lithuania has one of the lowest levels of life expectancy \\nin the EU. Although it has increased steadily since \\n2007, it only reached 75.8 years in 2017, more \\nthan five years below the EU average. In addition, \\nsubstantial inequalities persist by gender: women \\nlive nearly ten years more than men, mainly because \\nmen have greater exposure to risk factors. Overall, \\nthe majority of the population – particularly people \\non low incomes – reports not being in good health.\\nMore than half of all deaths in Lithuania can be \\nattributed to behavioural risk factors, including dietary \\nrisks, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and low \\nphysical activity. Despite some recent reductions brought \\nabout by alcohol control measures, alcohol consumption \\nis still the highest across EU countries, 25% above \\nthe EU average. High smoking prevalence, especially \\namong men, and obesity rates add to this challenge. In \\nrecent years, the authorities have taken action to curb \\nunhealthy behaviours, including through the National \\nHealth Strategy 2014-25. Some of the measures have \\nstarted to bring positive results, as testified by the \\nrecently observed reduction in alcohol consumption.\\nLithuania also grapples with some specific health \\nchallenges. Mental health is a major public health \\nissue, with the country reporting the highest mortality \\nrate from suicide in the EU. Important efforts have \\nbeen made in recent years to improve mental health \\nservices, which have contributed to initiate a reduction \\nin the number of deaths by suicide. Containment of \\nsome infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and \\nmeasles, also constitutes a public health challenge. \\nLithuania spends considerably less on health than \\nmost other EU countries. In 2017, health expenditure \\naccounted for 6.5% of GDP, the fifth lowest in the EU, \\nand well below the EU average of 9.8%. Furthermore, \\nonly about two-thirds of health expenditure is publicly \\nfunded in Lithuania, with out-of-pocket spending \\naccounting for a much greater share than nearly \\nall other EU countries. Greater public funding for \\nprevention and health care could help improve health \\noutcomes and reduce the financial burden for patients. General access to health services is good, yet high out-\\nof-pocket payments on outpatient medicines remain a \\nmajor barrier. Pharmaceuticals are the main driver of \\ncatastrophic expenditure on health, disproportionately \\naffecting low-income populations. It is expected that the \\nrecent reform of the co-payment system will contribute \\nto reducing the number of patients enduring financial \\nhardship when accessing pharmaceuticals. Continuing the \\nmonitoring and evaluation of these measures and their \\nimpact on health will help to guide future policy actions. \\nLithuania stands out as having much higher mortality \\nrates from preventable and treatable causes than other \\nEU countries, even those with similar health expenditure \\nlevels. The quality indicators of outpatient and inpatient \\ncare also lag behind those of most other EU countries. \\nThese indicators suggest that the system could improve \\nits effectiveness substantially. A further shift from \\ninpatient to primary care appears necessary to improve \\nhealth service quality and responsiveness. Although \\nhealth care quality monitoring and analysis have gained \\nattention in recent years, Lithuania lacks system-wide \\nsupport for continuous health care quality improvement.\\n  LITHUANIA\\nLithuania\\n0 10 20 3016%Smoking\\nBinge \\nDrinking\\nObesity35%19%\\n20%\\n16%\\n15%\\nEU Lithuania% of adult population\\nLITHUANIA\\n72                 State of Health in the EU: Companion Report 2019\\nLUXEMBOURG\\nLife expectancy in Luxembourg is among the highest \\nin the EU.

They also asked about the public’s preferred comm unication channels. The surveys showed that \\nindividual patients/consumers generally prefer to get information about COVID- 19 vaccines from the internet or \\nmass media. Organi sations and individual healthcare professionals prefer to get  information from national and \\ninternational health authorities’ sources. This supports EMA’s approach of using media, stakeholder engagement, and web- based formats to communicate about COVID -19 vaccines. \\nAnother example comes from visualisation tools developed by the Harding Center for Risk Literacy and German y’s \\nRobert Koch Instituteviii. The Harding Center  originally developed fact boxes that displayed benefits (in terms of \\ndisease outcome reduction) and risks (in terms of side effects) for vaccines, in addition to other health interventions  [42, 43], with an example below used for COVID -19 vaccines .
